# Math-Statistics
## 1. Nix Statistics
To solve statistical problems like Mean, Median, Modus, Range, Quartile, Standard Deviation, Variance from Individual Data(Data Tunggal) & Grouped Data(Data Berkelompok), for both Sample & Population. It's still in indonesian terms.<br>
Build in Delphi 7.<br>
## 2. Area Polygon
To counting Area of Polygon with input data is the coordinates points of polygon, as the result we got Area. The form of polygon will be display and the Area also.<br>
Polygon is multiple of triangles, the area of triangle count using Heron's formula. Total area of polygon is total areas of each triangle.<br> 
Build in Lazarus 1.8<br>
## 2. Polynomial Division
To counting when Polynomial divide by other polynomial.<br>
As the input is degree of Polynomial Dividend, Polynomial divisor, input in the grid table the coefficients of both polynomial.<br>
As the result we got Quotient and Remainder.<br> 
Build in Lazarus 1.8<br>
